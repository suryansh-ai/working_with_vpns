# VPN Usage & Security Evaluation

## Objective
Test the Windscribe free VPN service, verify its functionality, and analyze its benefits and limitations.

---

## Step 1: Choose a VPN Service
- Selected **Windscribe (Free version)** as it is reputable and offers multiple server options.  
- Created a free account successfully.  

---

## Step 2: Download & Install VPN Client
- Downloaded the Windscribe client from the official website.  
- Installed on Windows without issues.  

---

## Step 3: Connect to a VPN Server
- Connected to the **France server**.  
- Connection established and stable.  

---

## Step 4: Verify IP Address
- Checked `https://whatismyipaddress.com`.  
- IP address changed from the original ISP IP (India) to a **French IP (Windscribe assigned)**. ✅  

---

## Step 5: Test Encrypted Traffic
- Browsed several websites (Google, YouTube).  
- Confirmed traffic was encrypted and accessible without interruptions.  

---

## Step 6: Disconnect & Compare
- Disconnected VPN and tested browsing speed.  
- Without VPN → Faster speeds, original ISP IP restored.  
- With VPN → Slightly slower speeds due to encryption overhead and longer routing via France.  

---

## Step 7: Research on VPN Security (Findings)
- VPNs encrypt traffic using protocols like **OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec, WireGuard**.  
- Prevents ISPs and attackers on public Wi-Fi from snooping on data.  
- Masks IP address, providing anonymity by routing traffic through VPN servers.  
- Free VPNs often have limitations: fewer servers, lower speeds, and potential data logging risks.  

---

## Step 8: Summary of VPN Benefits & Limitations
### Benefits:
- Encrypts internet traffic, securing data from hackers/ISPs.  
- Hides real IP address, improving privacy and bypassing geo-restrictions.  
- Useful on public Wi-Fi networks to prevent eavesdropping.  

### Limitations:
- Free VPNs often come with **bandwidth caps** and **limited locations**.  
- Speeds may be reduced due to server congestion or encryption overhead.  
- Trust in the VPN provider is critical — some free services may log or sell user data.  

---

## Conclusion
Using **Windscribe**, the IP address was successfully masked to **France**, traffic was encrypted, and browsing worked normally with minor speed reductions.  
VPNs are powerful for **privacy and security**, but reliance on free services should be cautious due to performance and trust concerns.  
For long-term use, a **paid, no-log VPN** is recommended.
